Paytm-Landing Page
Additionally, this project demonstrates effective use of semantic HTML to ensure the webpage is accessible and SEO-friendly. Custom CSS was utilized to style components, ensuring they closely resemble the original Paytm design. I paid close attention to detail, including navigation menus, banners, and buttons, to provide an authentic look and feel. This project also served as an opportunity to practice code organization and clean, maintainable styling.
